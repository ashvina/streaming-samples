##### General pattern below should be added to control rate of components
# Name-of-a-component or id-of-instance or 
#   [required] tpm: tuples per minute, uniformly distributed 
#   [optional] amplitude: max variationr from tpm, e.g. if tpm=100, amplitude=10, then rate will vary between 90-110 
#   [optional] lambdaSec: length of one wave. The rate variation is a sin curve
#   [optional] container: last few characters of the container id


# time varying spout rate
"spout":
  tpm: "6000"
  amplitude: "1200"
  lambdaSec: "600"

# constant rate
"bolt-1":
  tpm: "2000"

# controlling bolt in a specific container, for e.g. to simulate a slow container
"bolt-2":
  tpm: "1000"
  container: "001"

# controlling a specific instance, for e.g. to simulate a slow instance
"100"
  tpm: "1000"
